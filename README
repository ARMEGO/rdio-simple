rdio-simple - a set of simple clients libraries for Rdio's web API.

These libraries for Python, PHP, Ruby, Node.js and Java implement the subset
of OAuth that is required to talk to the Rdio service with minimal external
dependencies.

Documentation is at: http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/rdiosimple
Examples for each language are under each language directory.

There is a testing framework that verifies that the languages implement
request signing consistently in the tests directory.
