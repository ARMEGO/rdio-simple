rdio-simple for Java

An Rdio client including a built-in OAuth implementation.

This has library only depends on libraries included by default in recent
versions of Java. It has been tested with Java 1.6.0.

To install the library simply copy the contents of the src/ directory into
your source code. There are three Java classes in there that you'll need to
include:
  - com.rdio.simple.Rdio
  - com.rdio.simple.Om
  - com.rdio.simple.Parameters

Usage:
To use the library just load the com.rdio.simple package:
  import com.rdio.simple.*;
Create an Rdio instance passing in an Rdio.Consumer object:
  Rdio rdio = new Rdio(new Rdio.Consumer("consumerkey", "consumersecret"));
Make API calls with the call(methodname, params) method:
  rdio.call("get", Parameters.build("keys", "a254895,a104386"));
Authenticate and authorize with the beginAuthentication and
completeAuthentication methods.

The current token (either request or access) is stored in rdio.token.

The library is somewhat thread-safe. It's safe to call functions from any
thread, but no API calls may be made in between beginAuthentication and
completeAuthentication calls.

Example:
There is an example that uses the rdio-simple Java library to list a user's
playlists. Compile it with:
  ant compile
and run it with:
  java -cp classes/ com.rdio.simple.examples.CommandLine.
Before you can compile or run it you'll have to create a:
  examples/com/rdio/simple/examples/ConsumerCredentials.java
with consumer credentials from http://developer.rdio.com/

There's an additional example available at:
https://github.com/rdio/rdio-simple-play-example
It's a web based example that uses the Play! framework.
